# KEEL
KEEL (Knowledge Extraction based on Evolutionary Learning) is an open source (GPLv3) Java software tool that can be used for a large number of different knowledge data discovery tasks. KEEL provides a simple GUI based on data flow to design experiments with different datasets and computational intelligence algorithms (paying special attention to evolutionary algorithms) in order to assess the behavior of the algorithms. It contains a wide variety of classical knowledge extraction algorithms, preprocessing techniques (training set selection, feature selection, discretization, imputation methods for missing values, among others), computational intelligence based learning algorithms, hybrid models, statistical methodologies for contrasting experiments and so forth. It allows to perform a complete analysis of new computational intelligence proposals in comparison to existing ones.

# Getting started with the pre-compiled version (www.keel.es -> Download)

1. First, note that Java version 7 needs to be installed on your system for this to work. Depending on your computing platform you may have to download and install it separately. It is available for free from Sun GET JAVA. If you have Java already installed in your system, please, update it to the latest version if you want to use the newest KEEL versions


2. Navigate into dist folder

3. Run the program: simply execute the "<b>GraphInterKeel.jar</b>" file

  Option 1: Right click on the jar icon by using the navigation utility of the OS

  Option 2: Execute the following command if you prefer to use a shell.

<pre>
java -jar ./dist/GraphInterKeel.jar
</pre>

Make sure you have properly setup the Java Path. For related issues, go to https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml.



# Getting started with the source code.

If you want to compile KEEL source code it is advisable to use the Apache Ant Tool (available for download at the The Apache Ant Project web page: http://ant.apache.org/). The KEEL Software tool includes a "<b>build.xml</b>" file to be used together with ant. To compile the KEEL project (assuming you have already installed ant) you just have to type the following commands:

<pre>
ant cleanAll
</pre>

This command erases previous binary files so that there aren't any conflicts with new binary builts.

<pre>
ant
</pre>

This command builds the whole KEEL project binaries using the available source code.

<pre>
ant doc
</pre>

This command generates the Javadoc documentation from the source code.

The installation of new data sets into the application can be done by importing them through the Data Management module or the Experiments module. These modules can convert data from several formats (CVS, ARFF, plain text) to KEEL format, thus allowing the user to quickly integrate them.

If you are interested on submitting some code to the KEEL project, please contact the Webmaster Team.
