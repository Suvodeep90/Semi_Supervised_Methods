<p>The Experiments Design part has the objective of designing the desired experiments using a graphical interface. Doubtless, this is the more innovative tool integrated in this program. The objective is to use available datasets and algorithms to generate a directory structure with all the necessary files needed to run the designed experiments in the local computer selected by the user. Now, you can forget scripts and others parameter files that made arduous the design of an experiment, and begin to use the new windows based interface.</p>

<p>With this program, you only need to select the input data (data sets), the algorithms you want to use and to make the opportune connections between them. Also it is possible to concatenate methods, insert statistical tests, etc...</p>

<p>The task which is more simplified is probably the configuration of the parameters; everything can be done from a simple dialog without requirement of external configuration files.</p>

<p>This part of KEEL has two main objectives: on the one hand, you can use the software as a test and evaluation tool during the development of an algorithm. On the other hand, it is also a good option in order to compare new developments with standard algorithms already implemented and available in KEEL 3.0.</p>
